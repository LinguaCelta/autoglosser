Creating indexes of all words in a corpus
==========================

Edit and run crate_combiwords.php, to create the holding table.

Edit and run sh_fill_combiwords, to fill the table.

create table combiwords_siar_uniq as select langid, surface, auto, count(surface) from combiwords_siar where langid!=999 group by langid, surface, auto order by langid, surface, auto
(now added to sh_fill_combiwords)

alter table combiwords_siar_uniq add column filename text
(now added to sh_fill_combiwords)

Edit and run unknowns/add_filename.php to add the filename of each entry to the filename column.   This is quite slow.

Export the resulting table to csv.

Open in oocalc and format page to landscape.
Datasort on langid and surface.
Set cell format to wordwrap, left-align, top.
Export as PDF.
