Creating indexes of all words in a corpus
==========================

Edit and run create_combiwords.php, to create the holding table.

Delete combiwords_{corpus}_uniq.

Edit and run sh_fill_combiwords, to fill the table.

Deprecated - create table combiwords_siar_uniq as select langid, surface, auto, count(surface) from combiwords_siar where langid!=999 group by langid, surface, auto order by langid, surface, auto
(now added to sh_fill_combiwords)

Deprecated - alter table combiwords_siar_uniq add column filename text
(now added to sh_fill_combiwords)

Run add_filename.php to add the filename of each entry to the filename column.   This is quite slow.

Export the resulting table to csv.

Open in oocalc and format page to landscape.
Datasort on langid and surface.
Set cell format to wordwrap, left-align, top.
Export as PDF.



Use this table to view unknowns:
create table patagonia_spa_unknowns as select * from combiwords_pat_uniq where auto='unk' and langid='spa' order by surface

To get a separate table with all fields so that the unknowns can be added to the dictionary, use the scripts in the unknowns folder.
