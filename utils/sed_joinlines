# This script converts the CLAN line-ends to spaces - it will ensure that  each utterance is on one line without breaks
# It also fixes some broken characters, and fixes errors like having no space between the last character of an untterance and the period.
# Run as: sed_joinlines /path/to/file.cha
chafile=$1  # the argument to the script; = the full path to the file - path/to/file.cha
#echo $chafile
filename=$(basename $chafile)  # the filename from the path - file.cha
#echo $filename
path=$(dirname $chafile)  # the path to the file - path/to
#echo $path
fixedfile=${filename%.cha}.txt  # switch the filename's extension to .txt for the output file - file.txt
#echo $fixedfile
fromdos $chafile  # get rid of the \r if the file has come from a Microsoft Windows machine; fromdos is in the tofrodos package

# 38: Straighten the lines by deleting line-ends - 5 runs should be enough to catch them all.
# 43: On surface lines, add a space before a period that immediately follows an alpha or digit.
