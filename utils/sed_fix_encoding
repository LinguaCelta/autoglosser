# This script fixes misencodings that are the result of a Welsh file in UTF-8 being passed through a non-UTF-8 computer, as well as some broken characters that passing through Microsoft Word seems to introduce.
#  Run as: sed_fix_encoding /path/to/file.cha
chafile=$1  # the argument to the script; = the full path to the file - path/to/file.cha
#echo $chafile
filename=$(basename $chafile)  # the filename from the path - file.cha
#echo $filename
path=$(dirname $chafile)  # the path to the file - path/to
#echo $path
fixedfile=${filename}.txt  # set up an output file
#echo $fixedfile
