General process
===========

Edit sh_unknowns to set up the corpus and language.

Running it will create a table for the unknowns, and another table for unique unknowns (using create_unk_table.php).

Then it will gather the unknowns from the files (using gather_unknowns.php) into the unknowns table, and run queries to select unique words and enter them into the unique table.

Then run add_filename.php to iterate over the unknowns table, gather all the filenames where a particular word occurs, and insert them into the unique table.  This allows you to go straight to the file(s) where a given word occurs, to check context.

Open the unique file in SQLWorkbench/J, and add information for each word (or delete it if it is incorrect).  Use phpPgAdmin to look up Welsh words in the dictionary as appropriate.


Useful queries while checking the words:
==========================

For words with one instance in a file:
select * from patagonia20_cgwords where utterance_id=(select utterance_id from patagonia20_cgwords where surface='aj√°' and langid='cym&spa') order by location

For words with multiple instances in a file (use if you get an error with the above):
select utterance_id, surface from patagonia33_cgwords where surface='uh' and langid='spa'

To get context:
select * from patagonia20_cgwords where utterance_id=449 order by location


When the words have all been dealt with, insert them into the main dictionary:
=================================================

Welsh:
insert into cylist (surface, lemma, enlemma, clar, pos, gender, number, tense, notes, extra) select surface, lemma, enlemma, clar, pos, gender, number, tense, notes, extra from patagonia_cym_unknowns_uniq

Spanish:
insert into eslist (surface, lemma, enlemma, clar, pos, gender, number, tense, notes) select surface, lemma, enlemma, clar, pos, gender, number, tense, notes from patagonia_spa_unknowns_uniq

English:
insert into enlist (surface, lemma, enlemma, pos, gender, number, tense, notes) select surface, lemma, enlemma, pos, gender, number, tense, notes from patagonia_eng_unknowns_uniq
