Enclitics in eslist

About 95% of the items in eslist are verbforms (654197 vblex + 389 vbser + ? vbhaver out of a total of 687846 items), and around 87% (566964) of those are verbforms with enclitics attached.  We can therefore trim the dictionary by omitting these, and having them analysed on the fly.  The following list sets out the combinations that are already in the dictionary, and which we should set up for analysis.

select * from eslist_big where surface~'búsque'

Once the clitics are stripped from (eg) dígame, there is no entry for the standalone díga (which would be orthographically incorrect), so we either have to do additional entries for these decliticised words, or strip the accents from them and then do a lookup.  May be better to add additional items, because allomorphs may occur that only exist in combination with the clitic forms (eg decí, digámo, dígan, díga; buscá, buscád, búsca, búsquen, etc).  To get these, we could pull out all the clitic forms from eslist_big into a new table, and do removes as above.  Write what's left into a new field, along with what's before the + in the pos field into a new field.  Then group by the verb part, and put that plus the pos entry into eslist as new entries.  In the register field we could note that it is a bound form used with clitics.  (An alternative is to look at whether we might not get better results by using a free conjugator for Spanish.)
 
Should the register field be changed to a name that reflects something a bit wider than that?  Notes?

create table clitics as select * from eslist_big where pos ~ 'prn.enc'

select verbform, count(verbform), declitpos from clitics_test group by verbform, declitpos order by verbform
select * from clitics_test where declitpos='vblex.imp.p1.pl'

create table clitic_forms as select verbform, count(verbform), lemma, enlemma, declitpos from clitics group by verbform, lemma, enlemma, declitpos order by verbform

select verbform, count(verbform) from clitic_forms where declitpos='vblex.imp.p1.pl' and verbform ~'m$' group by verbform order by verbform
delete from clitic_forms where declitpos='vblex.imp.p1.pl' and verbform ~'m$' -- to get rid of misanalysis where busquémosle gets analysed as busquém+os+le instead of busquémos+le (vblex.imp.p1.pl) -- deletion will not affect the remaining entries

delete from clitic_forms where verbform in (select surface from eslist)  -- remove forms (eg abandonar, vblex.inf) that already exist in eslist

Combine vblex.imp.p3.pl entries with vblex.imp.p3.sg
select * from clitic_forms where lemma='decir' order by verbform
update clitic_forms set declitpos='vblex.imp.p3.sp' where declitpos='vblex.imp.p3.sg'
delete from clitic_forms where declitpos='vblex.imp.p3.pl' and verbform ~ '[^n]$'

We are left with 15095 entries to add to eslist.  First, we need to adjust the pos info as in the queries below.

insert into eslist select * from eslist_big where pos !~ 'prn.enc'

select lemma, count(*) from eslist where enlemma is null and pos ~'vblex' group by lemma order by lemma
There are 30 verbsets where there is no enlemma - these will need to be added manually.

The Apertium dictionary contains an excessive number of categories for the POS tag - there are over 400 of these, many of them with only a few entries.  They seem to have gone overboard on determiners especially.

update eslist set mypos = 'n' where pos ~ 'n.(m|f).'
update eslist set gender = 'm' where pos ~ 'n.m.'
update eslist set gender = 'f' where pos ~ 'n.f.'
update eslist set number = 'sg' where pos ~ 'n.(m|f).sg'
update eslist set number = 'pl' where pos ~ 'n.(m|f).pl'

update eslist set mypos = 'adj' where pos ~ 'adj.'
update eslist set mypos = 'adj.sup' where pos ~ 'adj.sup'
update eslist set mypos = 'adj.pos' where pos ~ 'adj.pos'
update eslist set gender='m' where pos ~ 'adj.(sup.|pos.)m.'
update eslist set gender='f' where pos ~ 'adj.(sup.|pos.)f.'
update eslist set gender='mf' where pos ~ 'adj.(sup.|pos.)mf.'
update eslist set gender='mf' where pos ~ 'adj.mf.'
update eslist set gender='f' where pos ~ 'adj.f.'
update eslist set gender='m' where pos ~ 'adj.m.'
update eslist set number = 'pl' where pos ~ 'adj.*.pl'
update eslist set number = 'sg' where pos ~ 'adj.*.sg'

update eslist set mypos = 'adv' where pos = 'adv'
update eslist set pos='adv', mypos='adv' where pos='adv\n' - some of the adverbs have a newline after the entry; this errant \n is quite common, and subsequent queries try to expunge it as well
update eslist set pos='preadv', mypos='adv' where pos='preadv\n' or pos='preadv'

update eslist set mypos='prep' where pos='pr\n' or pos='pr'

update eslist set mypos='vinf' where pos ~ 'vbhaver.inf' or pos ~ 'vbser.inf' or pos ~ 'vbmod.inf' or pos ~ 'vblex.inf' 
update eslist set mypos='vfle' where pos ~ 'vbhaver.[^inf]' or pos ~ 'vbser.[^inf]' or pos ~ 'vbmod.[^inf]' or pos ~ 'vblex.[^inf]' - LOLZ: this does NOT select all verbforms that are not marked inf - it selects those which do not have i, n or f as the character following the first character after vbser (which just happens to be a dot, but the regex does not specify a dot)
update eslist set mypos='vfle' where pos ~ 'vbhaver.(fti|fts|ifi|imp)' or pos ~ 'vbser.(fti|fts|ifi|imp)' or pos ~ 'vbmod.(fti|fts|ifi|imp)' or pos ~ 'vblex.(fti|fts|ifi|imp)'
Note: should have been vbhaver in the above, not vbhacer (fixed).

select pos, count(*) from eslist where mypos is null group by pos order by pos

delete from eslist where pos ~ 'np.loc' or pos ~'np.cog' or pos ~'np.ant' or pos ~'np.al' or pos ~'n.acr' -- delete all names, since the autoglosser assumes that anything capitalised is a name

Freedict - tidy up using ad hoc F&R in Geany, and import; then delete anything that is already in eslist
delete from freedict_spa_eng where spa in (select surface from eslist)

Actually, it may be better to add these items as a separate field, so that we don't lose the synonyms.

update freedict_spa_eng set pos='v', tense='infin' where spa ~ '(a|e|i)r$' and spa !~' '
update freedict_spa_eng set pos='h' where spa ~ ' '
