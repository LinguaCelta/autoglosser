list words that do not have gloss entries:
select welsh, count(welsh) from stammers4_cgwords where gloss is null group by welsh order by count desc
but this is not accurate, because manual glosses have been added - this doesn't mean that the items are in cylist

CREATE TABLE cylist_add (

Adding new entries:
cylist has 416862 entries
delete from cylist where id > 416862
insert into cylist (surface, lemma, pos, gender, num, tense, reg, enlemma, mutation) select surface, lemma, pos, gender, num, tense, reg, enlemma, mutation from cylist_add

tagged as @0, but by definition these cannot be English, since they are mutated



Checking write_cgautogloss.php output
